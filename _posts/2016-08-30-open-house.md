It's time for the fall open house! Join us Saturday September 10th from 3-10pm at our new location 255 E. Liberty Street. We'll have good food, great people, and lots of tool demonstrations!

Check out the event calendar for a listing of classes taking place between September 6th-9th. We'll teach you all you need to know to get started using our Vinyl cutter, Laser Cutter, 3D printer, or the CNC machine.
