title: "Cryptoparty - Tor Edition!"
---

The Tor Project is having some hack days in Seattle, and Cryptoparty
Ann Arbor will be holding a hack day in solidarity!

Sunday October 2nd Cryptoparty members will be meeting up to
collectively learn about, work on, and experiment with tor and
everything tor-related. The goal is to explore things at a deeper and
more involved level than usually happens at the monthly cryptoparties,
which mostly cover the basics. This event is open to the public, as always! We'll start at
1pm and run until people decide to leave. 

We hope you'll join us on October 2nd at All Hands Active and be sure to bring your computer(s)!
