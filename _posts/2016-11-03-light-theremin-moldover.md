**About the artist:**

”A musician at heart, inventor born of curiosity, and innovator by necessity, I believe the world calls him the 'Godfather of Controllerism' for damned good reasons". -John Tackett, Crowd Wire

Historically there are only a handful of artists who have pushed the limits both with their music and with the instruments of its creation. What Bach was to the keyboard, what Hendrix was to the guitar, this is what Moldover is to the controller. Disillusioned with "press play DJs”, fans from all walks are drawn to Moldover shows, eager to witness electronic music’s return to virtuosity, improvisation, and emotional authenticity. Dig deeper into Moldover’s work and you’ll uncover a subversive cultural icon who has redefined physical media with his Instrument-Albums, revolutionized musical collaboration with his custom Jamboxes, and is inspiring an entire generation of forward thinking music-makers by openly sharing his methods and madness.
