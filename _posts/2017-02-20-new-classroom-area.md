Yesterday evening we opened a new section of the space setup as a classroom.

Thanks to everyone that helped make this happen. The space can be used immediately classes will start to be held on this side of the hall immediately. Cleanup and finishing work will continue over the next few weeks. Give us a shout at board@allhandsactive.org if you have any questions or feedback about the new space.
