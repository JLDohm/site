These are the current candidates for board membership for the April election. Please take some time to get to know them! Be sure to stop down and chat with them during our election night potluck at 7pm on April 20th. We'll be choosing 3 of them to fill the board.

Hello, I am Daniel. I have checked in on AHA from time to time over the last 7 years. I have helped AHA with Penguicon the last few years and AHA has helped me with <a href="http://enablingthefuture.org/">E-nable</a>. It has been great! I will work to continue those efforts.

As a board member, I would utilize skills I have picked up on the last few years. I have worked on a few Google Ad campaigns and can help get that wheel turning. AHA would benefit from converting long term visitors (like me) into members. I also will help with reaching out to new members through community engagement.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Hello! My name is Sarah Lynn I work as an Animal Technician at University of Michigan's, Unit for Laboratory Animal Medicine. My passion is science and adventures and I believe I can bring great things to All Hands Active. I've worked a lot with local conventions so I have a background in event planning, my main focus would be getting new members though engaging and creating events. I would also like to look into getting a mobile friendly interface for our website as well as implementing a "street team" to go to local community events to engage the community populous and inform them just how amazing All Hands Active truly is.

Whether building gadgets or communities, I feel it is something best done together. I've been an organizer both for local meetups (A2-Clojure &amp; previously Long Island Javascript) as well as 1000+ person TEDx events. When I learn something, I want to share that skill. Just in the last month, I've run classes for the eggbot and vinyl cutter. In July, I'll be teaching the first of many programming workshops for the Ann Arbor chapter of Big Brothers Big Sisters at All Hands Active.

Because I work in the new annex almost every weekday, and volunteer for public hours every Thursday, my schedule allows me to be uniquely responsive to issues as they arise. Currently, I'm limited to assisting in technical ways, but as a board member, I could also help with any administrative problems -- from payment processing to malfunctioning ID cards.

If you have any questions for me, or just want to talk about your AHA dreams, drop by anytime between 1:00 PM and 8:00 PM and I'd love to chat.

By trade I'm a journeyman electrician employed by the University of Michigan.  I've been in this role since 2006, and have worked all over the campus including the health system.  Before moving to Ann Arbor I worked in historic building renovation, filled a quality role for a sintered metal manufacturer, and completed a tool and die apprenticeship.

I've been an AHA volunteer and member for almost a year now.  I first learned of AHA last spring while searching for an Arduino class.  This happened to coincide with the time the space was preparing to move, so I was able to help get the new space ready for occupancy and make the move happen!  After the move I covered open build hours on Saturdays, and currently cover the Thursday evening open hours.

In this past year I've had the opportunity to get to know the space and its capabilities, as well as the people that make the space happen.  My first priority is being available to members and guests to help them bring their ideas to fruition.  In the background I try work on infrastructure projects to improve the space, electrical and otherwise.

If I were to become a board member, I would continue working to improve the physical space for its members and guests, and foster the welcoming atmosphere I was met with when I joined.  At the same time I would strive to learn what is needed to keep the space growing and help do the work to make it happen.
