Stop by All Hands Active on Friday June 16th for Ann Arbor <a title="Tech Trek" href="http://annarborusa.org/techtrek/">Tech Trek</a>!

Mini Lasers, Tube Clocks, Cardboard CNC machines, Electric Race Cars, and Light field displays are just some of the awesome things you'll get to experience at AHA when our members demonstrate their projects and <a title="Backyard Brains" href="https://backyardbrains.com/">Backyard Brains</a> shows off their research.

Haven't been to the shop in a bit? We'd love to give you a tours of our newly expanded location just below Afternoon Delight at 255 E. Liberty St.
