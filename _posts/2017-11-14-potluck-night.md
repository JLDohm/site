title: "Potluck Night this Thursday!"
---

Our traditional "Election Potluck Build Night" will be happening this Thursday the 16th, from 7:00PM to 10:00PM (or until folks decide to go home).

We've had exactly three nominees agree to take on our three available Director positions for this term, so there will be no election this time around.  However, come out anyway with a dish to pass, and get to know your fellow AHA members!
