Elections for the next Board of Directors are coming up! Beginning today is the
nomination period for prospective Directors. We are looking to fill three of our
Board positions during this election (see the list below).

We are an official 501(c)(3), and our current goals are to attract new members,
interesting projects, and exciting workshops to the new space. We need to build
the community of makers and hackers that use our workshop. If you think you can
help us achieve this very important objective, please consider running for the
Board of Directors! A Director’s term is one year long.

The powers of the Board of Directors are explicitly laid out in the AHA Bylaws,
and since Directors take responsibility for financial activities they must:

* have no financial conflicts of interest
* make a donation of any amount amount of money
* engage with and support the standing committee activities of Fundraising
 (development), Financial (operations), and Governance.

Here’s the breakdown of important dates for elections: Today until April 14th at
11:59PM: Call for nominations. Interested in running for a position on the AHA
Board of Directors? You can nominate yourselves or others by replying to this
email or in a new thread on the Google Groups. Be sure to include the nominee's
name, current projects, and why they would be a great board member for AHA!
Nominees must explicitly state that they accept nominations offered by other
members to be considered in the running.

April 15 until April 19 at 7:00PM: Absentee voting. If you know you will
miss the election, email the Board for guidance on how to vote absentee.

April 19 7:00 PM to 10:00PM – Elections Party: We host a themed Build Night
in which the goal is to build a Board! Converge on AHA at 7:00PM, eat
potluck-style foods, and cast your ballot. We will tally votes promptly at
10:00PM.

April 20 at Midnight: Elected Board Members are put into place!

The actual voting process will involve assigning each nominee a score from 1 to
N (N being the number of nominees we have by the end of the 16th). Higher
numbers represent the nominees you favor most, *with 1 being your
least-favored*. We will add up all of your scores and pick the three
highest-scoring nominees, who will become the newest Directors.

If you are a fully-paid Standard Member, Student Member, Coworker, or have a
Staff Volunteer membership in November, you are entitled to one vote. You may
become a member at any time up until the 19th if you would like to be counted in
this election.

And here’s the current Board: 
- Henry Marshall (I)
- Brian Morse (I)
- Kim Burton
- Nathan Yost (I)
- Demure Demeanor

Incumbent Board Members who have completed their term are denoted by (I). We
will be electing members to fill their position.

If you have questions or matters of a sensitive nature, you can email the
current board directly at board@allhandsactive.org.

Thank you! Let's get those nominations coming in, and we'll see you at elections
on April 19th at 7:00PM!
