# Our Mission

Makers gather at All Hands Active. We take our world and play with it like legos. Mixing and matching recipes of life like a top chef with a picky client. A dash of electronics, a pinch of art, a scoop of biology and a MONSTER amount of awesome!

All Hands Active is a volunteer-run 501(c)(3) non-profit community organization. We want to make Ann Arbor smarter, through hosting classes and workshops to share our skills, by making our tools and workshop accessible to the wider community, and by cultivating a welcoming community of hackers, makers, and creative types.
