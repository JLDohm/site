# How it Works
{: .text-center}

We’d love to have you join our community workspace.  Our most valuable asset is our members’ skills, desire to share knowledge, and passion to make Ann Arbor smarter! You’ll gain access to low and high tech tools, many of which you likely won’t have at home (CNC/Laser Cutter/3D Printer/Vinyl Cutter). We provide networking opportunities for creative folks to experience the pulse of the Maker movement as we help to educate those in the Ann Arbor Area.
